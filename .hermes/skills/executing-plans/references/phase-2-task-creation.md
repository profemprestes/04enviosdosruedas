# Phase 2: Task Creation (executing-plans)

**CRITICAL**: You MUST use TaskCreate to create ALL tasks BEFORE executing any task. Task creation must complete before dependency analysis or execution begins.

1. **Extract Tasks from _index.md**: Read `_index.md` only. Parse the inline YAML metadata in the "Execution Plan" section to extract:
   - `id`: Task identifier (e.g., "001")
   - `subject`: Brief title in imperative form (e.g., "Implement login handler")
   - `slug`: Hyphenated slug for filename (e.g., "implement-login-handler")
   - `type`: Task type (test, impl, setup, config, refactor)
   - `depends-on`: Array of task IDs this task depends on (e.g., ["001"])

2. **Create Tasks First**: Use TaskCreate to register every task
   - Set `subject` from YAML `subject` field
   - Set `description` to: "See task file: ./task-{id}-{slug}-{type}.md for full details including BDD scenario and verification steps"
   - Set `activeForm` by converting subject to present continuous form (e.g., "Setting up project structure")
   - All tasks MUST be created before proceeding to the next phase
   - Do NOT read individual task files during this phase — they are read on-demand during execution

3. **Analyze Dependencies**: After all tasks are created, build the dependency graph
   - Compute dependency tiers: Tier 0 = no dependencies, Tier N = all depends-on tasks are in earlier tiers
   - Within each tier, group tasks by type to maximize parallelism (e.g., all "write test" tasks together, all "implement" tasks together)
   - **Identify Red-Green Pairs**: Scan all task filenames for matching NNN prefixes (e.g., `task-002-auth-test` + `task-002-auth-impl`). Mark each such pair as a **Red-Green pair** — these are always scheduled as a coordinated unit in the same batch. The test task retains its Tier 0 position; the impl task follows immediately after in the same batch execution (not a separate batch).
   - **Target**: Each batch should contain 3-6 tasks
   - **Rule**: Every batch must contain ≥2 tasks unless it is the sole remaining batch

4. **Setup Task Dependencies**: Use TaskUpdate to configure dependencies between tasks
   - `addBlockedBy`: Array of task IDs this task must wait for before starting
   - `addBlocks`: Array of task IDs that must wait for this task to complete
   - Example: `TaskUpdate({ taskId: "2", addBlockedBy: ["1"] })` means task #2 waits for task #1
