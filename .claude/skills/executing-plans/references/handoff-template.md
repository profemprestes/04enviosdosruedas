# Handoff Summary Template

## Overview

Handoff summaries are the cross-batch memory substrate for the context-reset execution architecture. Every batch produces one. Together with `handoff-state.md` (the rolling mutable snapshot), they form the ONLY cross-batch memory the spawned per-batch coordinator can rely on — the main agent never replays batch execution transcripts.

**Two artifacts, distinct roles:**
- `handoff-state.md` — rolling, rewritten each batch; the live cumulative snapshot the next coordinator reads
- `handoff-summary-{N}.md` — immutable per-batch record; progress artifact for retrospective + audit

## When to Produce

Unconditional: produce `handoff-summary-{N}.md` after every completed batch. No size gate, no task-count threshold. `{N}` is the batch number.

## File Naming and Location

Place handoff summary files in the plan directory alongside task files:

```
docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-plan/
  _index.md
  task-001-setup.md
  task-002-impl.md
  ...
  handoff-summary-1.md    # After first boundary
  handoff-summary-2.md    # After second boundary
```

**Naming pattern:** `handoff-summary-{N}.md` where `{N}` is a sequential integer starting at 1.

## Template Structure

Each handoff summary contains exactly 5 sections in this order. Follow the Handoff Summary Format defined in `evaluation-file-formats.md` for the canonical field definitions.

### Section 1: Completed Tasks

Table of all tasks marked `completed` up to this boundary.

```markdown
## Completed Tasks

| ID | Subject | Checklist Result | Batch |
|----|---------|------------------|-------|
| 001 | Set up project structure | PASS (all items) | 1 |
| 002 | Write auth handler tests | PASS (all items) | 1 |
| 003 | Implement auth handler | PASS (all items) | 1 |
```

**Column definitions:**
- **ID**: Task identifier from the plan
- **Subject**: Brief imperative title from the task
- **Checklist Result**: Binary PASS/FAIL result from checklist evaluation. Omit this column entirely if evaluation mode is not active.
- **Batch**: Batch number in which the task was executed

### Section 2: Remaining Tasks

Table of all tasks not yet completed at this boundary.

```markdown
## Remaining Tasks

| ID | Subject | Status | Dependencies |
|----|---------|--------|--------------|
| 004 | Create API endpoints | pending | 003 |
| 005 | Write integration tests | pending | 004 |
| 006 | Add error handling | in_progress | 003 |
```

**Column definitions:**
- **ID**: Task identifier from the plan
- **Subject**: Brief imperative title from the task
- **Status**: Current TaskList status (`pending`, `in_progress`, `blocked`)
- **Dependencies**: Comma-separated list of task IDs this task depends on, or `none`

### Section 3: Key Decisions

Bulleted list of architectural or design decisions made during execution that affect remaining work.

```markdown
## Key Decisions

- Chose PostgreSQL connection pooling over per-request connections (task 002) -- affects all DB tasks
- Adopted repository pattern for data access layer (task 003) -- remaining impl tasks must follow
- Deferred pagination to a follow-up plan (task 004 blocker discussion) -- do not implement in remaining tasks
```

Include only decisions that influence how remaining tasks should be executed. Omit routine implementation choices.

### Section 4: File Ownership

Table mapping files modified during execution to the last task that modified them.

```markdown
## File Ownership

| File Path | Last Modified By Task |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| src/auth/handler.ts | 003 |
| src/auth/handler.test.ts | 002 |
| src/db/connection.ts | 001 |
| src/config/database.yml | 001 |
```

**Column definitions:**
- **File Path**: Relative path from project root
- **Last Modified By Task**: ID of the most recent task that wrote to this file

This map helps identify potential merge conflicts and clarifies which task owns each file for remaining work.

### Section 5: Blockers

List of unresolved blockers accumulated during execution.

```markdown
## Blockers

- [BLOCKER-001] Missing API specification for `/users` endpoint -- blocks task 005 (reported at batch 2)
- [BLOCKER-002] Flaky CI on macOS runner -- intermittent failure in task 004 verification (reported at batch 3)
```

If no blockers exist, state explicitly:

```markdown
## Blockers

None.
```

## Production Rules

1. **Read TaskList** to get current task statuses before generating any section
2. **Populate all 5 sections** -- do not omit any section, even if empty (use "None." for empty lists)
3. **Increment the summary number** sequentially from the last handoff file in the plan directory
4. **Do not modify TaskList** -- the handoff summary reflects state, it does not change state
5. **Do not commit by default** -- handoff files are ephemeral artifacts unless the user opts in to committing them

## Reference

Handoff summary files follow the Handoff Summary Format defined in `evaluation-file-formats.md`. Consult that reference for canonical field definitions, scoring abbreviations, and format conventions shared across all evaluation-related file types.
