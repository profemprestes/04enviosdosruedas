# Sprint Contract Template

## Overview

Sprint contracts are produced per-batch by the executing-plans skill before execution begins. They replace implicit done criteria with concrete, testable checklists that the batch executes against.

**Core principle:** Execution does not start until the contract file exists. The executing-plans skill writes the contract; the evaluator later grades completed work against it.

The contract format follows the Sprint Contract Format defined in `evaluation-file-formats.md`.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Written by | Executing-plans skill |
| Read by | Evaluator agent and batch executors |
| Timing | Phase 3 step 0 -- before batch execution begins |
| File naming | `sprint-contract-batch-{N}.md` |

## Template Structure

Each sprint contract contains exactly 6 sections in this order, matching the Sprint Contract Format from `evaluation-file-formats.md`.

### Section 0: Preamble (optional — injected only when prior batches show recurring failures)

By default, executing-plans Phase 4 step 2 scans prior evaluation reports for checklist items that FAILed in 2+ batches and injects them here. The section is omitted entirely (the contract begins directly with the Tasks section) when no recurring failures were detected in prior batches — the common case for first-pass-PASS plans, where every batch's evaluator returned PASS without rework. Empirically observed across 7-batch real plans.

**Injection point:** When patterns exist, they appear here as a bulleted list with rationale. The executor reads these patterns as context before implementing the batch.

```markdown
# Batch 3 Sprint Contract

## Recurring Failure Patterns (from prior batch analysis)

This section is automatically injected when recurring failures are detected:

- **Pattern: Incomplete error handling** — Prior batches left try/catch blocks empty or with bare `pass`. Ensure every error path is implemented with specific recovery logic.
- **Pattern: Missing test assertions** — Prior batch assertions were trivial (always True). Write assertions that verify specific expected values.

---
```

If no recurring patterns are detected or the feature is disabled, omit this section and the contract begins directly with the Tasks section.

### Section 1: Tasks

Table listing every task in the batch with its identifier, subject, and type.

```markdown
# Batch 2 Sprint Contract

## Tasks

| ID | Subject | Type |
|----|---------|------|
| 003 | Create user authentication handler | impl |
| 004 | Add input validation middleware | impl |
| 005 | Write auth handler test | test |
```

### Section 2: Acceptance Criteria (auto-derived)

**CRITICAL — auto-derive only**: Acceptance criteria are mechanically derived from each task file's `## BDD Scenario` section (Then-clauses) using the rules in `## Acceptance Criteria Derivation` below. Do NOT author new criteria from scratch. Do NOT paraphrase. Each Then-clause produces exactly one acceptance criterion. This eliminates duplicate spec between `_index.md` task YAML, individual task files, and the sprint contract.

Per-task checklist of testable, binary pass/fail items. Each criterion maps directly to a verifiable outcome.

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

### Task 003: Create user authentication handler

- [ ] Handler accepts username and password parameters
- [ ] Returns JWT token on successful authentication
- [ ] Returns 401 status on invalid credentials
- [ ] Logs authentication attempts with timestamp

### Task 005: Write auth handler test

- [ ] Covers successful login scenario
- [ ] Covers invalid password scenario
- [ ] Covers missing username scenario
```

### Section 3: Red-Green Pairs

Table mapping test tasks to their implementation counterparts with expected BDD states.

```markdown
## Red-Green Pairs

| Test Task | Impl Task | Expected Red State | Expected Green State |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 005 | 003 | Test runs, assertions fail (no handler exists) | Test passes after handler implementation |

Tasks not part of a Red-Green pair have no Red state expectation.
```

### Section 4: Evaluation Criteria Preview

List the checklist items (ID + description) the evaluator will apply to this batch. This feedforward lets the generator know upfront what will be assessed, improving first-pass output quality.

```markdown
## Evaluation Criteria Preview

The evaluator will apply the following checklist items to this batch:

| Item ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| CODE-VER-01 | All verification commands exit with code 0 |
| CODE-QUAL-01 | No TODO/FIXME/NotImplementedError patterns in produced files |
| CODE-QUAL-02 | No hardcoded stubs, skeleton-only bodies, or placeholder implementations |
```

Derive this table by reading the latest `docs/retros/checklists/code-v{N}.md` and extracting each item's ID and description. Do not embed the full checklist item — ID and description only.

### Section 5: Sign-off

Contract generator identity, readiness status, and revision count. The `Revision` field is `0` for the original contract and increments by 1 every time the contract is rewritten due to scope change (see `SKILL.md` Phase 3 step 0). Each archived `sprint-contract-batch-{N}.v{M}.md` carries the value it had at the moment it was superseded; the canonical `sprint-contract-batch-{N}.md` always holds the latest revision number. Audits trace contract drift by reading `Revision` and counting the `.v*.md` archives in the plan directory.

```markdown
## Sign-off

- **Generator:** executing-plans
- **Timestamp:** 2026-04-02T10:30:00Z
- **Status:** READY
- **Revision:** 0
```

## Red-Green Pair Distinction

Red-Green pairs enforce the BDD cycle within the sprint contract. The executing-plans skill identifies these pairs during contract generation and defines distinct done criteria for each role.

### Test Tasks (Red State)

A test task is done when: **tests are written and failing for the right reason (Red state).**

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Test file exists and compiles | Yes | Missing or syntax errors |
| Test assertions target correct behavior | Yes | Assertions are trivial or unrelated |
| Test fails because production code is absent | Yes | Test fails due to test bug |
| Test failure message describes expected behavior | Yes | Opaque or misleading failure |

Example acceptance criterion for a test task:

```markdown
### Task 005: Write auth handler test

- [ ] Test file compiles without errors
- [ ] Running tests produces assertion failures (not import errors or syntax errors)
- [ ] Each test targets a specific BDD scenario from the feature spec
- [ ] Failure messages clearly state what behavior is missing
```

### Implementation Tasks (Green State)

An implementation task is done when: **all tests pass (Green state, exit code 0).**

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| All paired tests pass | Exit code 0 | Any assertion failure |
| No stub or placeholder code | Real logic in every function | `pass`, `TODO`, `NotImplementedError` |
| Existing tests still pass | Full suite green | Regression in unrelated tests |

Example acceptance criterion for an implementation task:

```markdown
### Task 003: Create user authentication handler

- [ ] All tests in auth handler test suite pass (exit code 0)
- [ ] No `TODO`, `FIXME`, or placeholder patterns in handler code
- [ ] Handler implements all scenarios defined in the BDD feature file
- [ ] Existing test suite shows no regressions
```

### Non-Paired Tasks

Tasks that are not part of a Red-Green pair (setup, config, refactor) use standard acceptance criteria. Done = verification command exits 0 and all checklist items satisfied.

## Acceptance Criteria Derivation

Derive testable criteria from BDD scenarios using this process.

### Step 1: Extract from Given/When/Then

Each BDD scenario maps to one or more acceptance criteria. Convert Then-clauses into binary checklist items.

| BDD Element | Maps To |
|-------------|---------|
| Given | Precondition the test must set up (not a criterion itself) |
| When | Action under test (not a criterion itself) |
| Then | One acceptance criterion per Then-clause |
| And (after Then) | Additional acceptance criterion |

Example derivation:

```gherkin
Scenario: Successful login
  Given a registered user with username "alice" and password "secret"
  When the user submits valid credentials
  Then the response status is 200
  And the response body contains a JWT token
  And the token expires in 24 hours
```

Produces three acceptance criteria:

```markdown
- [ ] Returns 200 status on valid credentials
- [ ] Response body contains a JWT token
- [ ] Token expiration is set to 24 hours
```

### Step 2: Ensure Binary Verifiability

Every criterion must be answerable with yes or no. Rewrite vague criteria until they pass this test.

| Vague (reject) | Binary (accept) |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "Handles errors properly" | "Returns 400 with JSON error body when input is missing" |
| "Performance is acceptable" | "Response completes within 200ms for 100 concurrent requests" |
| "UI looks correct" | "Login button is disabled while request is in flight" |

### Step 3: Identify Edge Cases

Scan BDD scenarios for missing coverage. Flag gaps and add criteria for:

| Edge Case Category | What to Look For |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Error paths | Missing Then-clauses for invalid input, network failure, timeout |
| Boundary conditions | Empty strings, zero values, maximum lengths, off-by-one |
| Concurrency | Duplicate submissions, race conditions, stale data |
| Security | Injection, unauthorized access, expired tokens |

If a BDD scenario lacks error path coverage, the contract generator adds criteria derived from the task type. Example: an auth handler task without a "wrong password" scenario gets:

```markdown
- [ ] Returns 401 when password is incorrect
- [ ] Returns 400 when username field is missing
```

## Ambiguity Detection and Flagging

The contract generator scans acceptance criteria for ambiguous language before writing the contract.

### Identifying Vague Then-Clauses

Flag any Then-clause that contains these patterns:

| Pattern | Example | Problem |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Subjective adjective | "Then the response is fast" | No measurable threshold |
| Passive with no actor | "Then the data is processed" | Unclear what "processed" means |
| Missing observable | "Then the system handles the error" | No visible outcome specified |
| Catch-all verb | "Then everything works correctly" | Not testable |

### Flagging and Resolution Protocol

When the contract generator detects ambiguity, flag it in the contract with a suggested concrete alternative:

```markdown
### Task 003: Create user authentication handler

- [ ] Returns JWT token on successful authentication
- [ ] **[AMBIGUOUS]** "Handles invalid input gracefully"
  - Suggested: "Returns 400 with JSON body `{\"error\": \"missing_field\", \"field\": \"<name>\"}` when a required field is absent"
- [ ] Logs authentication attempts with timestamp
```

### Autonomous Resolution Protocol

1. Detect ambiguity while deriving acceptance criteria from tasks and BDD scenarios
2. Rewrite the criterion into the most concrete binary form supported by the available evidence
3. If ambiguity remains, mark it as `[AUTO-RESOLVED]` and log the applied interpretation directly in the contract file — do NOT prompt the user

Use a single generation pass. Do not stall execution waiting on a separate negotiation loop.

```markdown
- [ ] **[AUTO-RESOLVED]** "Handles edge cases appropriately"
  - Applied interpretation: validates non-empty strings and rejects payloads over 1MB
```

## Contract Lifecycle

The sprint contract follows a strict lifecycle tied to the batch execution phases.

```
Phase 3, Step 0          Generator              Execution              Grading
     |                      |                      |                     |
  Generator            Launches batch         References            Evaluator scores
  writes               after contract         criteria              against contract
  contract             exists                 during impl
     |                      |                      |                     |
  sprint-contract-     Batch starts only      Each task checks      Evaluation report
  batch-{N}.md         after file exists      its acceptance        references contract
  written                                    criteria              criteria
```

| Stage | Actor | Action | Artifact |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| Generation | Executing-plans skill | Writes contract from plan tasks, task files, BDD scenarios, and checklist preview | `sprint-contract-batch-{N}.md` |
| Execution | Generator | Implements against acceptance criteria | Source code, test files |
| Grading | Evaluator | Scores work against contract criteria | `evaluation-round-{N}-batch-{M}.md` |

**Critical gate:** Execution does not start until the contract file exists in the plan directory. The generator MUST NOT begin any task in the batch before writing and reading the contract.

## Single-Mode Contract (per-batch, mandatory)

There is only one sprint-contract mode: one contract per batch, written as `sprint-contract-batch-{N}.md` in the plan directory. Intensity modes (`light` / `standard` / `thorough`) have been removed — the per-batch contract is unconditional. Plans that previously would have qualified for `light` still produce per-batch contracts.

## Reference

The sprint contract format follows the Sprint Contract Format defined in `evaluation-file-formats.md`. Consult that reference for canonical field definitions and format conventions shared across all evaluation-related file types.
