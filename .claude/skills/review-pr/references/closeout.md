# Closeout: Merge Decision First, Then Ceremony

Once the PR is merge-ready (all `[ci]` checks terminal and passing, every comment either
fixed, rejected-with-reply, or escalated-and-decided, and resolved comments hidden + their
threads resolved), **ask the user whether to merge first** — before any ceremony. The
closeout ceremony (summary comment + body rewrite) runs only on a merge choice; "Don't
merge" skips it and wraps up.

Do this exactly once, at the end, after the Phase 4 stop conditions hold. The merge step is
the last action before `TaskStop`.

## Merge decision — ask first

The Phase 4 gate holds: every `[ci]` check terminal + passing, every comment reflected on
(resolved ones hidden + threads resolved; only `escalate` items remain visible). Ask the
user — via `AskUserQuestion` — whether to merge, before writing anything. **Merging is
hard to reverse and outward-facing**, so it requires an explicit user choice every time;
never auto-merge, and never merge past open `escalate` comments without surfacing them.

### Arm the closeout state first

The moment the Phase 4 gate holds, arm the closeout state **before anything else**:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/review-pr/scripts/arm-closeout.sh "$PR"                # explicit ask
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/review-pr/scripts/arm-closeout.sh "$PR" --auto-merge   # opt-in
```

Arming writes `.git/review-pr-closeout.json` (resolved via `git rev-parse --git-dir`, so it
works from any cwd in the repo). While the file exists, the plugin's Stop hook
(`hooks/closeout-stop.sh`) blocks one turn-end per user turn with a message naming the PR and
the missing step — the merge ask cannot be skipped by a premature or hallucinated stop, and
the reminder does not loop: the hook passes through (`stop_hook_active`) on the second
end-attempt of the same turn, so the turn ends once the reminder is injected. A user
interrupt also bypasses it — the hook's message always names the clear script as the escape
hatch.

Clear it the moment the decision is resolved:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/review-pr/scripts/clear-closeout.sh "$PR"
```

Clear after the user answers (any choice, including "Don't merge"), after the auto-merge
completes, or after the opt-in aborts (merge failure, user interrupt, or the gate no longer
holds — auto-merge is single-shot and consumed either way). Leaving it armed blocks the next
stop; the hook's message repeats the clear path as the escape hatch. The clear script only
removes state matching `$PR`, so an interrupted closeout for one PR never deletes a pending
one for another.

### When the hook fires: verify the problem is real

The Stop hook blocks on the state file alone — it cannot know whether the closeout was
already resolved and the clear step was simply missed. That happens after an interrupt (the
ask was answered, then the turn died before the clear), a resumed session, a summary already
posted, or a merge that already landed (manual or otherwise). So before acting on a block,
**verify the pending closeout actually exists**:

- **Simple checks — judge directly.** e.g. `gh pr view "$PR" --repo "$REPO" --json state,mergedAt`
  (a MERGED PR means the closeout is done and the state is stale), or the
  `<!-- review-pr:summary -->` marker lookup (a posted summary means the ask was already
  resolved).
- **Complex or ambiguous situations — spawn an independent subagent with clean context.**
  e.g. reconstructing whether the merge question was asked earlier in the session, or whether
  the gate (CI green, zero open escalate) still holds after events that landed after arming.
  The main context is biased by sunk cost, so let a fresh agent verify and follow its verdict
  — the same pattern as the Phase 3 triage agent.

A verified-stale state means the enforcement already did its job: clear it
(`clear-closeout.sh "$PR"`) and end the turn — do not re-ask, do not run the ceremony. A
verified-real state: proceed with the closeout as below.

Ask one question, four mutually exclusive options:

- **Create a merge commit** (Recommended — listed first; the default merge strategy)
- **Squash and merge**
- **Rebase and merge**
- **Don't merge**

If unresolved `escalate` comments remain on the PR, include the count in the question text
(e.g. "Note: 2 escalated comments are still open for your decision") so the user merges
with eyes open. The user may still choose to merge — that is their call, not the skill's.

- **On a merge choice**: proceed to the ceremony below, then run the matching `gh pr merge`
  (`--merge --delete-branch` / `--squash --subject "<title>" --delete-branch` / `--rebase --delete-branch`).
  `--delete-branch` is safe only in the main worktree when no open PR still bases on that head.
  If the closeout runs in a linked worktree (`/github:resolve-issues`), omit `--delete-branch`
  — delete the remote head separately if stack-safe, leave the local branch for `ExitWorktree`.
  Never `--auto`.
- **On "Don't merge"**: skip the ceremony and post-merge hygiene entirely; fall through to
  `TaskStop`. The ceremony is idempotent — if the user later wants the record, re-running
  closeout patches the existing summary rather than duplicating it.

## The ceremony (only on a merge choice)

The PR page should read as an accurate, self-contained record of the change: a summary
comment in the user's voice recording the review cycle, and a rewritten title/body
describing what is actually being merged.

### What the summary must cover

The user asked for two things in the closeout comment. Both are required:

1. **What was changed** — the substantive code/config changes across the review cycle
   (each `fix` round, summarized by commit). Not a git-log dump: group related commits and
   say what each group accomplished and why.
2. **What review surfaced and what was done about it** — for each comment batch, the
   outcome: adopted (with the fix), rejected (with the one-line reason), or escalated
   (and how it was resolved). This is the audit trail a reader needs to trust the merge.

Write it in the user's voice and first person ("I changed…", "Review flagged…, I fixed…").
No emojis, no marketing tone. Terse but complete.

### Write the summary comment

The body opens with the marker `<!-- review-pr:summary -->`. GitHub renders HTML comments as
nothing, and it makes the summary findable later without guessing which comment it was.

`gh pr comment` prints the new comment's URL on stdout — capture it. The PR body's Review-cycle
line links to that URL, which is why the comment must be posted *before* the body is rewritten.

```bash
SUMMARY_URL=$(gh pr comment "$PR" --repo "$REPO" --body-file - <<'EOF'
<!-- review-pr:summary -->
Summary of the review cycle on this PR.

## Changes made
- <group 1: what changed and why, in one or two lines>
- <group 2: ...>

## Review findings and resolution
- <Adopted> @<reviewer> on <path>:<line> — <what the comment was> → fixed in <sha>.
- <Rejected> @<reviewer> on <path>:<line> — <comment> → declined: <one-line reason>.
- <Escalated> @<reviewer> — <comment> → resolved by <decision>.

All CI checks are green and no comments remain worth adopting. This PR is ready to merge.
EOF
)
```

`--body-file -` reads the heredoc from stdin, so multi-line bodies (and the user's actual
commit/review data pasted into the placeholders) work without shell-escaping pain. Replace
the placeholders with the real data gathered during Phases 1–4 before running.

#### Updating an existing summary

If a summary was already posted (a resumed session, a re-run after an interrupt), edit that
comment in place rather than posting a duplicate. Do NOT use `gh pr comment --edit-last`: it
edits your *most recent* comment on the PR, which may be a Phase 3 reject reply rather than
the summary, and overwrites it. Look the summary up by its marker and patch that exact id:

```bash
# `--paginate` runs the jq filter per page, so `.[] | select(...)` sees every page.
SUMMARY_ID=$(gh api --paginate "repos/$REPO/issues/$PR/comments" \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | startswith("<!-- review-pr:summary -->")) | .id' | head -1)

# An empty SUMMARY_ID means no summary exists yet — post one with the block above instead.
SUMMARY_URL=$(gh api --method PATCH "repos/$REPO/issues/comments/$SUMMARY_ID" \
  -F body=@- --jq .html_url <<'EOF'
<!-- review-pr:summary -->
...same template, updated...
EOF
)
```

`-F body=@-` sends stdin verbatim as a string: the `@` prefix short-circuits gh's type coercion
and its `{owner}`/`{repo}`/`{branch}` placeholder expansion, so markdown passes through intact.

### Rewrite the PR title and body

The original PR title/body were written before the review cycle; by closeout the change may
have shifted scope, merged batches, or dropped approaches. Rewrite both so the PR page reads
as an accurate, self-contained description of what is actually being merged.

```bash
# Body is always rewritten. Title is rewritten ONLY if the current one no longer matches
# the merged change (see Title guidance below); drop --title when the title is already
# accurate.
gh pr edit "$PR" --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "<imperative, lowercase, conventional-commits if the repo uses them>" \
  --body-file - <<'EOF'
## What
<one-paragraph statement of what this PR changes>

## Why
<the problem or motivation; link issues if any>

## Changes
- <logical change 1>
- <logical change 2>

## Review cycle
<N> comments triaged over <R> rounds, <M> adopted, <K> rejected; all CI green.
Full breakdown: <paste $SUMMARY_URL here, e.g. https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/4#issuecomment-4930992385>

## Verification
- <test commands run and their results>
- <manual checks performed>
EOF
```

**The Review-cycle line MUST carry the summary comment's URL.** A count with no link is not a
pointer — the whole point is that a reader landing on the PR can reach the audit trail in one
click. The heredoc is quoted (`<<'EOF'`), so `$SUMMARY_URL` will NOT expand inside it: read the
URL that the previous command printed and paste it as a literal. Do not switch to an unquoted
heredoc to interpolate it — PR bodies contain backticks and `$` in code references, and an
unquoted heredoc would run them as command substitution.

#### Title guidance

Rewrite the title only when the current one no longer matches the merged change (scope
drifted, the feature was renamed, the original was a WIP stub). If the title is already
accurate, leave it — **drop the `--title` flag from the command above and just rewrite the
body**; do not churn the title for style. When rewriting:
- Imperative mood, lowercase, under ~70 chars.
- Match the repo's conventions (conventional-commits prefix like `feat(scope):` if the
  repo's history uses it; plain imperative otherwise).
- The PR title does not need the commit-message body rules — it is a UI title, not a commit.

#### Body guidance

The body is the durable record. Lead with **What** and **Why** (a reviewer who never read
the comments should understand the PR from the body alone), then **Changes** (the logical
units, not commit-by-commit), then a one-line **Review cycle** pointer *linking to the summary
comment*, then **Verification** (real commands + results, not claims). Keep it scannable —
headings and bullets, not prose walls.

The pointer is what makes the pair work: the body stays short and describes the merged change,
the linked comment holds the full comment-by-comment audit trail, and neither repeats the other.

## Auto-merge branch (`--auto-merge` opt-in)

When `--auto-merge` was parsed in Phase 1, the closeout swaps the `AskUserQuestion` step for
an automatic merge — but only under the same stop conditions that gate the question. The flag
is an opt-out from the *prompt*, not from the *readiness gate* or the *ceremony*: the summary
comment + body rewrite still run first, so the merged PR carries the record.

**Pre-merge gate (ALL must hold, same as the explicit-choice path):**
1. Every `[ci]` check is terminal AND passing.
2. Every non-escalate comment is reflected on: `fix` pushed, `reject` replied, resolved ones
   hidden + threads resolved. Only `escalate` items may remain visible.
3. No open `escalate` comments. ← this is the hard switch

**If any `escalate` comment is still open, the auto-merge opt-in is suspended for this closeout.**
**Re-arm the closeout state without `--auto-merge`** (`arm-closeout.sh "$PR"`) so the Stop
hook enforces the explicit ask, then fall back to the explicit `AskUserQuestion` (four
options, merge listed first as Recommended) and include the escalate count in the question
text. Do not merge past escalate items just because the flag was set — escalate means "needs
human judgment", and auto-merging past it is exactly the over-reach the explicit-choice rule
exists to prevent. The user may still pick merge from the question; that is their call.

**If the gate holds (CI green, zero open escalate), execute:**
1. Run the ceremony first — summary comment + body rewrite (above), so the record is on the
   PR before the merge lands.
2. Send a `PushNotification` that the PR is about to auto-merge — merge is hard to reverse and
   outward-facing, so warn the user before it lands (they may still interrupt to stop it).
   One line: e.g. "PR #<n>: CI green, no open comments — auto-merging with a merge commit."
3. Run `gh pr merge "$PR" --repo "$REPO" --merge --delete-branch` (safe only in the main
   worktree when no open PR still bases on that head; in a linked worktree, omit
   `--delete-branch` — delete the remote head separately if stack-safe, leave the local
   branch for `ExitWorktree`). Never `--auto`.
4. Clear the closeout state (`clear-closeout.sh "$PR"`) — the opt-in is consumed by the merge.

**Single-shot.** Auto-merge is a one-shot choice for this PR. If the merge fails (branch
protection, required reviews, stale base), surface the error, clear the closeout state, and
stop — do not retry with different flags, do not force-push, and do not re-arm auto-merge;
the user decides next. If the user interrupts and you resume, and the gate no longer holds (a
new comment arrived, CI re-ran red), do not auto-merge — re-check the gate, and if escalate
items now exist, fall back to the explicit question. Either way, clear the closeout state
once the opt-in is resolved (completed or aborted) — while it stays armed, one turn-end per
user turn is blocked until the decision is settled.

**On a successful auto-merge**, proceed to "After a successful merge" hygiene exactly as the
explicit-choice path would. `TaskStop` the Monitor.

If merge fails (branch protection, required reviews, stale base), surface the error; do not
retry with different flags or force-push.

## After a successful merge

Default cleanup — run all of these unconditionally on a merge choice (no opt-out):

1. **Remove the linked worktree first, before any switch.** Detect whether the closeout is
   running in a linked worktree (`/github:resolve-issues`):
   ```bash
   [ "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" != "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" ] && echo "linked worktree"
   ```
   If linked, `ExitWorktree action:"remove"` — it deletes the worktree and its local branch
   and returns the session to the main worktree. If it refuses (uncommitted changes), confirm
   with the user before `discard_changes: true`. Then delete the remote head separately if
   stack-safe (no open PR still bases on it).
2. **Switch to `main` and sync.** Now in the main worktree, run:
   ```bash
   git fetch --prune
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
   ```
   Repeat the `--ff-only` pull for `develop` and the PR's `baseRefName` when present on
   origin (check each out first, then land back on `main`). Never force long-lived branches.
3. Delete every local branch already merged into `main`/`develop` (except the current branch).
   ```bash
   git branch --merged main | grep -v '^\*\|main\|develop' | xargs -r git branch -d
   ```
4. `git worktree prune` to remove stale administrative records.
5. Scan `.claude/worktrees/` for stale worktree directories whose branch is already merged
   or no longer exists. Report them to the user and suggest manual `rm -rf` removal.

## Stacked / chained PRs (base branch is a shared dependency)

When several PRs depend on each other — PR-B's `--base` is PR-A's head branch, not
`main` — **the base branch is a load-bearing dependency**, not a scratch branch. A
chain breaks in a specific, silent way that is easy to miss:

- PR-A merges into `main` with `--delete-branch`. Its head branch is deleted.
- PR-B (and PR-C, …) had `--base = <PR-A head branch>`. When that branch is deleted,
  GitHub auto-retargets their base to `main`, **but their merge commits were created
  against the now-deleted branch and become dangling** — the content of PR-B/C lands
  on **nothing**, and `main` advances with only PR-A's changes. The PRs show `MERGED`
  on GitHub, which is the trap: the merge state lies. The only reliable check is
  `git branch -r --contains <head-sha>` against `origin/main` — if it says no, the
  content is not on `main` despite the MERGED badge.

**Two safe patterns for a stack:**

1. **All PRs base on `main` directly** (no inter-PR base). Land them in order; each
   merge advances `main` and the next PR's base is already current. Simplest; prefer
   this unless the intermediate state is genuinely unreviewable on its own.
2. **Keep the base branch alive until every downstream PR is merged.** Merge the
   stack top-down (or in dependency order); do not delete a head that open PRs still
   base on.

If you suspect a stack already broke (PRs MERGED but content absent from `main`):
open one repair PR off `origin/main` that cherry-picks each missing head commit, and
link the dangling PRs in the body. Verify the repair with `git branch -r --contains
<sha> origin/main` before merging.

**Don't pre-announce implementation-detail strings in docs a parallel agent will
write.** When a stack splits docs (PR-E) from the code that emits a string
(PR-B), the docs author will name the string from intuition — `manual-blocks-initial`
— instead of the real `manual-skips-initial`. The review bots catch it, but it costs
a round-trip. If a downstream PR documents a value another PR produces, put the
exact literal in the upstream agent's prompt and have it referenced verbatim, or
land docs after the code PR merges so the author can grep the real value.

## Order and idempotency

1. **Arm the closeout state** (`arm-closeout.sh "$PR"`, appending `--auto-merge` when opted
   in) — the Stop hook enforces the merge decision from here on.
2. **Ask the merge question** via `AskUserQuestion` (Phase 4 gate holds). This is the first
   closeout step — the ceremony below runs only on a merge choice. Clear the closeout state
   (`clear-closeout.sh "$PR"`) the moment the answer is in, any choice.
3. On a merge choice: hide + resolve the fully-addressed comments (Phase 3 closeout)
   **first** — the summary comment should land on a clean PR. Re-sweep if a final CI push
   landed after the last closeout pass.
4. Post the summary comment, capturing its URL.
5. Rewrite the title/body, linking the Review-cycle line to that URL.

Steps 4 and 5 are ordered, not merely sequential: the body needs a URL that does not exist
until the comment is posted. Never rewrite the body first and backfill the link later.

6. Merge step — depends on the opt-in:
   - **No flag (default)**: the ask in step 2 was the question; run `gh pr merge` with the
     strategy the user chose, appending `--delete-branch` (see "Merge decision" above for
     the linked-worktree caveat). Never `--auto`.
   - **`--auto-merge` opt-in**: the gate held with zero open `escalate` items, so step 2
     was skipped; after the ceremony (steps 3–5), send a `PushNotification` then run
     `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch` directly (omitting `--delete-branch` in a linked
     worktree, same rule as the explicit path). If any `escalate` item is open, suspend
     auto-merge and fall back to the explicit question. Clear the closeout state after the
     merge completes or after the opt-in aborts (failure, interrupt, or gate no longer holds)
     — it is single-shot, consumed either way.
7. After a successful merge: remove the linked worktree (`ExitWorktree action:"remove"`) + switch to `main` + sync `main`/`develop` + delete merged local branches + `git worktree prune` + scan stale worktrees (see "After a successful merge" above).
8. `TaskStop` the Monitor (the closeout state is already cleared).

Steps 3–5 (the ceremony) are idempotent: re-running `gh pr edit` with the same title/body is
a no-op, and the marker lookup patches the existing summary rather than duplicating it (which
also recovers `SUMMARY_URL` after an interrupt). Steps 6 and 7 are NOT idempotent — only run
them once, after the user's explicit merge choice (or, under `--auto-merge`, the gate
holding). If the user interrupts and you resume, skip steps already completed; if they chose
"don't merge" — or merge + hygiene already ran — do not repeat, and do not run the ceremony
either (the ask gates it). Under `--auto-merge`, if the gate no longer holds on resume (new
comment or CI re-ran red), do not auto-merge — re-check and fall back to the explicit
question if escalate items now exist. If an interrupt left the closeout state armed, clear
it when the closeout is resolved (ask answered or opt-in consumed); while armed, one turn-end
per user turn is blocked until then.

## Do not

- Do not ask to merge or post the summary while comments are still open or CI is still red —
  the gate must hold first, and the summary would claim a merge-ready state that is not true.
- Do not end the turn with the closeout state armed — the Stop hook blocks it. Clear it
  (`clear-closeout.sh "$PR"`) as soon as the decision resolves; while it stays armed, one
  turn-end per user turn is blocked with a message naming the PR and the missing step.
- Do not run the ceremony (summary comment + body rewrite) before the user's merge choice —
  the ask comes first, and "Don't merge" skips the ceremony entirely.
- Do not rewrite the title/body to claim something the diff does not deliver.
- Do not include the closeout summary inside the PR body AND as a comment — the body
  describes the change; the comment records the review cycle. They are different records.
- Do not ship a Review-cycle line without the summary comment's URL. Counts alone strand the
  audit trail somewhere in a long comment thread.
- Do not edit the summary with `gh pr comment --edit-last` — it targets whatever you commented
  last, not the summary. Find it by its `<!-- review-pr:summary -->` marker.
- Do not write the summary in the AI's voice or sign it as AI-generated; the user asked for
  it in their name.
- Do not merge without the user's explicit choice OR the `--auto-merge` opt-in — the merge
  requires an explicit `AskUserQuestion` choice every time, unless the user set `--auto-merge`
  AND the pre-merge gate holds with zero open `escalate` items. Never call
  `gh pr merge --auto` (GitHub's background auto-merge feature, which fires whenever it can and
  bypasses your own gate); under `--auto-merge` use `gh pr merge --merge` (a direct merge you
  execute only when the gate holds). Never merge past open `escalate` comments without
  surfacing them — under `--auto-merge`, that means falling back to the explicit question
  instead of merging.
