# Executing Plans

Execute written implementation plans through phase-based orchestration: Plan Review → Task Creation → per-batch coordinator dispatch + verification → Git Commit → Completion. Each batch runs in a fresh sub-agent (Agent tool) so the main agent's context never accumulates batch execution transcripts. Execution spans multiple batches across turns — **the recommended way to run it is wrapped in Claude Code's built-in `/goal`** (see below).

## Recommended: run wrapped in `/goal`

**Launch it under Claude Code's built-in `/goal`** (v2.1.139+) so the run continues to completion instead of stopping after a batch:

```
/goal "Claude has emitted the Phase 6 completion message 'Plan execution complete. All N tasks verified and committed' AND has reported the final commit hash from Phase 5 in the transcript" /superpowers:executing-plans <plan>
```

`/goal` is a **user-typed outer wrapper** — it must prefix the invocation; a skill cannot enable it for itself mid-run. The evaluator judges only what Claude narrates in the transcript (it does NOT read files or run commands) — phrase the condition against narrated output, never filesystem state. **Note**: executing-plans commits **once** at Phase 5 after all batches finish — do NOT phrase the condition around a "per-batch commit hash" or it will never match; per-batch evaluator verdicts are progress signals, not completion signals. Full semantics and condition phrasing: `../../skills/references/goal-wrapper.md`. The skill body itself is single-turn-driven and orients via `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/executing-plans/scripts/batch-progress.sh"` at the top of every turn (see Step 1 below).

## Step 1 of every iteration — orient via batch-progress.sh

**Before doing anything else, run:**

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/executing-plans/scripts/batch-progress.sh" <plan-path>
```

The script reads the plan dir, counts `sprint-contract-batch-*.md` and `handoff-summary-*.md` files, and emits a precise next-action directive ("Batch 3 active — Agent next" / "Batch 2 closed — TaskList then commit-or-next-batch" / "Batch 4 not yet started — Phase 3 steps 0-1-2"). Read the output as your authoritative "where am I" signal and follow the directive. This replaces the old loop's per-iteration filesystem scan + injection — same data, scoped to this skill.

Skip this step on the very first invocation (no plan-path resolved yet) — fall through to "First Action" below.

## CRITICAL: Bail-Out Check (run first, on first invocation only)

Read `_index.md`. If "Execution Plan" YAML lists < 5 tasks in a single batch, bail out: skip coordinator + sprint contract; execute tasks inline and commit. `--force` token in `$ARGUMENTS` bypasses. See `./references/bail-out.md` for the response template. If that inline work needs a plain "keep going until condition X holds" loop, use `/goal` directly.

## First Action — Resolve Plan Path

**Resolve the plan path, then orient.**

1. Resolve the plan path:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` provides a path (e.g., `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-plan/`), use it
   - Otherwise, pick the `*-plan/` folder whose basename sorts last under `YYYY-MM-DD-*-plan/` — i.e., the highest date prefix in the name, not filesystem mtime. Use `ls -1d docs/plans/*-plan/ 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -1` (do NOT use `ls -t` / `ls -1dt` — directory mtimes get bumped when an older folder's files are edited, which makes it rank above a freshly-created folder). Use the result directly (no confirmation).
   - If no plan folder is found, abort with a clear error message naming the expected path pattern
2. Run `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/executing-plans/scripts/batch-progress.sh" <plan-path>` to print the current batch state. The bare path `scripts/batch-progress.sh` does NOT resolve — the skill runs in the plan's repository cwd, not the plugin dir, so the script must be addressed by its absolute plugin path. If batches already exist, follow the script's directive directly (skip Phase 1/2 — they ran on a prior turn). Otherwise proceed with Initialization.

## Initialization (first turn only)

1. **Plan Check**: Verify the folder contains `_index.md` with "Execution Plan" section. Consult the docs index before spawning any batch: `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/docs-index.sh" show <plan-path>`. If the row's status is `expired:`, REFUSE — the plan has been invalidated by a retro and is no longer authoritative; tell the user which retro invalidated it and stop. If the status is `implemented:<old-sha>` (rework after ship), run `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/docs-index.sh" set-status <plan-path> "wip"` BEFORE spawning batch 1 so the index reflects that the plan is being worked again. Then consult memory: run `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/docs-index.sh" list --kind memory --status active` and Read the top topically-relevant matches before Phase 1 "Plan Review."
2. **Context**: Read `_index.md` completely. This is the source of truth for your execution.

## Background Knowledge

**Core Principles**: Review before execution, batch verification, explicit blockers, evidence-driven approach.

**MANDATORY SKILL**: `superpowers:behavior-driven-development` must be loaded regardless of execution mode.

> **CRITICAL — two internal gate skills are load-bearing, not optional.** Every implementer sub-agent prompt MUST instruct loading `superpowers:verification-before-completion` before reporting any task done (no completion claims without fresh verification evidence pasted in the return), and the batch coordinator MUST load `superpowers:receiving-code-review` before acting on an evaluator REWORK verdict (verify each rework item against the codebase; no blind implementation). Omitting either from a coordinator prompt is a protocol violation. Details: `./references/batch-execution-playbook.md` (Agent Prompt Template + Rework Loop).

## Definition of Done

See `./references/definition-of-done.md` (non-negotiable; overrides all other guidance).

## Phase 1: Plan Review & Understanding

1. **Read Plan**: Read `_index.md` to understand scope, architecture decisions, and extract inline YAML task metadata from the "Execution Plan" section.
2. **Understand Project**: Explore codebase structure, key files, and patterns relevant to the plan.
3. **Check Blockers**: See `./references/blocker-and-escalation.md`.
4. **Pre-Flight Conflict Scan** (once, before Phase 2): Check every task's explicit instructions against the resolved `code-v{N}.md` checklist for contradictions (e.g. a task mandating a stub or duplicated logic the checklist forbids). No-op if none found. See `./references/preflight-conflict-scan.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Creation (MANDATORY)

See `./references/phase-2-task-creation.md`.

## Phase 3: Batch Execution Loop (Context-Reset Architecture)

See `./references/phase-3-orchestration.md` and `./references/batch-execution-playbook.md`.

> **CRITICAL — declare a model on every sub-agent dispatch.** When you spawn a batch coordinator or any reviewer via the Agent tool, always pass an explicit `model` (`sonnet` for ordinary implementation/verification, `opus` only for hard reasoning or final whole-branch review, `haiku` for mechanical sweeps). An unspecified `model` silently inherits the session's most expensive tier — left to choose, dispatches drift to top-tier and burn the budget. Pick the cheapest tier the work allows; never let it default.

> **CRITICAL — the native `Workflow` tool is opt-in only.** Never call `Workflow` unless the user has explicitly opted into multi-agent orchestration (said "use a workflow" / equivalent, or ultracode is on). A run under `/goal` must NOT silently fan out background agents. Without opt-in, use the default bounded Agent-tool spawn rounds and surface the option in one line. Opt-in rules and task mapping: `../../skills/references/workflow-orchestration.md`.

## Phase 4: Verification & Feedback

See `./references/phase-4-verification.md`.

## Phase 5: Git Commit

Commit the implementation changes using git-agent (with git fallback).

**Actions**:
1. Run: `git-agent commit --intent "<feature description>" --co-author "Claude <Model> <Version> <noreply@anthropic.com>"`
2. On auth error, retry with `--free` flag
3. **Fallback**: If git-agent is unavailable or fails, invoke the `/git:commit` skill via the Skill tool; full ladder in `../../skills/references/git-commit.md`

**CRITICAL — flip the plan's docs-index row post-commit (do-not-defer).** After the implementation commit lands, flip the plan's index row to `implemented`: `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/docs-index.sh" set-status <plan-path> "implemented:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"`. Then commit the index update as its own tiny commit: `git-agent commit --no-stage --intent "mark <plan> implemented in docs index"`. NEVER use `--amend` — it would rewrite history and confuse the Stop hook's `completion_commit` detection (the hook keys off the tip commit on the plan's modified-files set; an amended tip silently repoints it).

**CRITICAL — conditional memory-write step, folded into the same follow-up commit above (do-not-defer).** Gated on the existing intra-plan-learning variety-gap signal (`references/intra-plan-learning.md:54` — all checklist items PASS for a batch but the batch required 2+ rework rounds before reaching PASS). If any batch this run hit that signal, also write `docs/memory/pitfall_<slug>.md` capturing the recurring rework cause, then run `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/docs-index.sh" upsert memory docs/memory/<path> --status active --summary "<one-line>" --category pitfall`, staged into the same dedicated follow-up commit created above — do not create a separate commit for it. This variety-gap trigger is explicitly distinct from the separate hard-abort cap at batch-execution-playbook.md:165 (max 2 rework rounds before escalation), which is NOT a memory-write trigger — that cap governs the rework loop's hard stop, not memory capture. If no batch hit the variety-gap signal, this step is a no-op.

See `../../skills/references/git-commit.md` for patterns, templates, and requirements. Commit only after all tasks are completed; use a meaningful feature scope.

## Phase 6: Completion

Verify all tasks are complete, then output the completion summary.

1. **Final Task Audit**: Use TaskList to confirm every task has status `completed`. If any task is `in_progress` or `pending`, do NOT proceed — return to Phase 3 to finish remaining tasks.
2. **Summary message**: "Plan execution complete. All [N] tasks verified and committed." (human-facing; not a machine trigger — see note below).

> **Completion log is automatic.** You do NOT write `docs/retros/plans-completed.jsonl` yourself. The plugin's single `Stop` hook (`hooks/stop-state-sync.sh`) detects plan completion from durable on-disk state — every batch handed off (`handoff-summary-*` count ≥ batch count) plus a git commit touching the `handoff-state.md` modified-files set — and appends the `plan_completed` event mechanically, first-completion-only. Detection is state-based, not keyed off any sentence you emit, so it survives paraphrasing or a skipped summary. That log is what `/superpowers:retrospective` Phase 5a reads `completion_commit` from. See `../retrospective/references/evolution-protocol.md` §Plan Completion Log Schema for the row shape.

## Exit Criteria

All tasks executed and verified, evidence captured, no blockers, final verification passes, git commit completed. This skill runs fully autonomously — no user approval step exists. For unattended multi-turn continuation, wrap in `/goal` (see top of file).
