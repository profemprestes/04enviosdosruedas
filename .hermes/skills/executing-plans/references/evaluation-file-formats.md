# Evaluation File Formats

Single source of truth for all evaluation-related file formats. The evaluator agent and executing-plans skill both reference this file.

## File Location and Lifecycle

All evaluation files live in the plan directory alongside task files (e.g., `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-plan/`).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Written by | Executing-plans skill |
| Read by | Executing-plans skill and evaluator agent |
| Committed | NOT committed by default -- these are ephemeral working artifacts |
| Cleanup | Deleted after plan execution completes, or kept if user explicitly requests |

## 1. Sprint Contract

**File naming:** `sprint-contract-batch-{N}.md` (e.g., `sprint-contract-batch-1.md`)

**Purpose:** Define the scope, acceptance criteria, and expected BDD states for a batch before execution begins. The executing-plans skill writes this contract; the evaluator later grades against it.

### Format

```markdown
# Batch {N} Sprint Contract

## Tasks

| ID | Subject | Type |
|----|---------|------|
| 003 | Create user authentication handler | impl |
| 004 | Add input validation middleware | impl |
| 005 | Write auth handler test | test |

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task 003: Create user authentication handler

- [ ] Handler accepts username and password parameters
- [ ] Returns JWT token on successful authentication
- [ ] Returns 401 status on invalid credentials
- [ ] Logs authentication attempts with timestamp

### Task 004: Add input validation middleware

- [ ] Validates required fields are present
- [ ] Sanitizes string inputs against XSS
- [ ] Returns 400 with field-level error messages on validation failure

### Task 005: Write auth handler test

- [ ] Covers successful login scenario
- [ ] Covers invalid password scenario
- [ ] Covers missing username scenario

## Red-Green Pairs

| Test Task | Impl Task | Expected Red State | Expected Green State |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 005 | 003 | Test runs, assertions fail (no handler exists) | Test passes after handler implementation |

Tasks not part of a Red-Green pair have no Red state expectation.

## Evaluation Criteria Preview

The evaluator will apply the following checklist items to this batch:

| Item ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| CODE-VER-01 | All verification commands exit with code 0 |
| CODE-QUAL-01 | No TODO/FIXME/NotImplementedError patterns in produced files |
| CODE-QUAL-02 | No hardcoded stubs, skeleton-only bodies, or placeholder implementations |

## Sign-off

- **Generator:** [agent identifier]
- **Timestamp:** [ISO 8601 timestamp]
- **Status:** READY
- **Revision:** [0 for original, increments per scope-change rewrite]
```

### Field Definitions

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Tasks table | Yes | Every task in the batch with ID, subject, and type |
| Acceptance Criteria | Yes | Per-task checklist with testable, binary pass/fail items |
| Red-Green Pairs | Yes | Omit rows if batch has no pairs; keep the section with "None" |
| Evaluation Criteria Preview | Yes | Checklist items (ID + description) the evaluator will apply; derived from latest `code-v{N}.md` |
| Sign-off | Yes | Contract generator identity, generation timestamp, and `Revision` count (0 for original; archived predecessors live at `sprint-contract-batch-{N}.v{M}.md`) |

## 2. Evaluation Report

**File naming:** `evaluation-round-{N}-batch-{M}.md` (e.g., `evaluation-round-1-batch-2.md`)

**Purpose:** Assess completed work against the sprint contract using binary checklist evaluation. The evaluator produces the assessment content, and the executing-plans skill persists it as a file. Identifies rework items and whether execution should pivot.

**Location convention:** Evaluation artifacts are stored in the plan directory (e.g., `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}-plan/`). When a separate evals directory is used, derive the path by replacing `-plan/` with `-evals/` in the plan path.

### Format

```markdown
# Evaluation Round {N} -- Batch {M}

## Checklist Results

| Item ID       | Check                                   | Result | Evidence                                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| REQ-TRACE-01  | All requirements map to >=1 scenario    | PASS   | 7/7 requirements traced                         |
| SCEN-CONC-01  | Given clauses use specific data         | FAIL   | bdd-specs.md:23 -- "some valid user data"       |
| RISK-02       | Mitigations specify concrete actions    | PASS   | All 3 mitigations specify concrete mechanisms   |

## Rework Items

| Item ID      | File         | Location | Issue                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SCEN-CONC-01 | bdd-specs.md | line 23  | Replace "some valid user data" with concrete values (email, password) |

## Pivot Flag

- **Pivot:** false
- **Rationale:** All tasks on track. Rework items are localized fixes, not architectural issues.

When pivot is `true`, include:
- Root cause referencing the specific repeated error pattern
- Suggested plan modifications
- Tasks to cancel or re-scope

## Run Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Evaluator input tokens | {N or "N/A"} |
| Evaluator output tokens | {N or "N/A"} |
| Evaluation duration | {N}s |
| Checklist version | {mode}-v{N} |

Token counts are best-effort: extracted from API response `usage` field if available. Duration is wall-clock time from evaluator spawn to completion. This section is informational only -- it does not affect the verdict. Absence of token data does not block evaluation or rework.

## Verdict: REWORK
1 item FAIL: SCEN-CONC-01
```

### Field Definitions

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Checklist Results | Yes | One row per checklist item with PASS/FAIL result and evidence |
| Rework Items | Yes | Empty table if no FAIL items; keep the section |
| Pivot Flag | Yes | Always present with true/false and rationale |
| Run Metrics | Yes | Best-effort token/duration tracking; use "N/A" when unavailable |

## 3. Handoff Summary

**File naming:** `handoff-summary-{N}.md` (e.g., `handoff-summary-1.md`)

**Purpose:** Capture cumulative state at the end of an evaluation cycle. Enables context recovery if the session restarts or a new agent takes over.

### Format

```markdown
# Handoff Summary {N}

## Completed Tasks

| ID | Subject | Checklist Result | Batch |
|----|---------|------------------|-------|
| 001 | Set up project scaffolding | PASS (all items) | 1 |
| 002 | Configure CI pipeline | PASS (all items) | 1 |
| 003 | Create user authentication handler | PASS (all items) | 2 |

## Remaining Tasks

| ID | Subject | Status | Dependencies |
|----|---------|--------|--------------|
| 006 | Implement session management | pending | 003 |
| 007 | Add logout endpoint | pending | 003, 006 |
| 008 | Write session management test | pending | -- |

Use `--` for tasks with no dependencies.

## Key Decisions

- Chose JWT over session cookies for stateless auth (Batch 1, Task 003)
- Deferred rate limiting to a separate follow-up plan (Evaluation Round 1)
- Switched validation library from zod to valibot after benchmark showed 40% smaller bundle (Batch 2, Task 004)

## File Ownership

| File Path | Last Modified By Task |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| src/auth/handler.ts | 003 |
| src/auth/handler.test.ts | 005 |
| src/middleware/validate.ts | 004 |
| src/config/auth.ts | 001 |

## Blockers

- None

If blockers exist, list each with:
- Blocker description
- Affected task IDs
- Escalation status (reported / waiting / resolved)
```

### Field Definitions

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Completed Tasks | Yes | All tasks marked completed across all batches so far |
| Remaining Tasks | Yes | All pending or in-progress tasks with dependency info |
| Key Decisions | Yes | Architectural or process decisions made during execution |
| File Ownership | Yes | Maps every modified file to the task that last changed it |
| Blockers | Yes | Active blockers; write "None" if clear |

## 4. Design Evaluation Report

**File naming:** `evaluation-design-round-{N}.md` (e.g., `evaluation-design-round-1.md`)

**Purpose:** Assess a completed design against the design checklist. The evaluator produces the assessment content; the brainstorming skill persists it as a file in the design folder.

**Written by:** brainstorming skill (from evaluator text output)

### Format

```markdown
# Design Evaluation Round {N}

## Checklist Results

| Item ID | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| REQ-TRACE-01 | All requirements map to >=1 scenario | PASS | 5/5 requirements traced |
| SCEN-CONC-01 | Given clauses use specific data | FAIL | bdd-specs.md:23 -- "some valid user" |

## Rework Items

| Item ID | File | Location | Issue | Rework Action |
|---------|------|----------|-------|---------------|
| SCEN-CONC-01 | bdd-specs.md | line 23 | Replace "some valid user" with concrete values | Use specific username and email values |

## Verdict: REWORK
1 item FAIL: SCEN-CONC-01
```

If verdict is PASS, the Rework Items table remains present but empty.

### Field Definitions

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Checklist Results | Yes | One row per checklist item with PASS/FAIL and evidence |
| Rework Items | Yes | Empty table if no FAIL items; keep the section |
| Verdict | Yes | PASS (all items PASS) or REWORK (count and IDs of FAIL items) |

(Plan-mode evaluation has no formal report. writing-plans Phase 4 sub-agent reflection produces an inline summary recorded in the main agent's turn output; sub-agent FAILs are addressed in Phase 4 step 3 before the Phase 5 commit, and the post-commit `git show` diff is the user's audit surface. No `evaluation-plan-round-*.md` file is written.)

## 5. REWORK Resolution Protocol

When any evaluation report (Design / Code) returns verdict `REWORK`, the consuming skill (brainstorming / executing-plans coordinator) MUST process Rework Items deterministically. This section is the single source of truth so both consumers behave identically.

### Processing Order

1. Read the report's Rework Items table top-to-bottom — do NOT cherry-pick which to fix
2. For each row in order:
   - Locate `File:Location` (line number or section reference)
   - Apply `Rework Action` literally — the action text is the spec
   - If the action is ambiguous, pick the most concrete interpretation per the "Autonomous Resolution Protocol" in `sprint-contract-template.md`; do NOT prompt the user mid-rework
3. After all rows processed, re-spawn evaluator (round N+1)

### Round Limit

| Round | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Apply all rework items, re-spawn evaluator |
| 2 | Apply remaining rework items, re-spawn evaluator |
| 3+ | Escalate per `blocker-and-escalation.md` — do NOT attempt round 3 |

The evaluator assesses independently each round; previous PASS items can fail in a later round if the rework introduced regressions.

### Multi-File / Multi-Location Rework

When a single Item ID's rework spans multiple locations (e.g., `SCEN-CONC-01` flagged 3 lines), the report lists one row per location. Process all rows for the same Item ID before moving to the next Item ID — this preserves the "fix this category, then move on" mental model and reduces cross-item regression.

### When Rework Action References Missing Information

If a Rework Action says "Add task for: <scenario>" but the scenario name doesn't appear in the design, do NOT invent it — the evaluator likely mis-read. Skip the row and surface the discrepancy back via the next round's evidence column. Looping on missing info is forbidden.

### Cross-Skill Consistency

This protocol is authoritative. Skill SKILL.md files MUST NOT redefine REWORK handling — they reference this section. If evaluator output format changes, update this section first; consumers follow.
