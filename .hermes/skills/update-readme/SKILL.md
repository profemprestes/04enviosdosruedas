# Update README

Keep README.md (English, primary) and README.zh-CN.md (Simplified Chinese, secondary) in sync with the project's actual current state. Both files must be accurate, complete, and consistent with each other.

## CRITICAL: Ground Truth and Header Format

- Write from ground truth, not from memory or assumption. Every skill/component listed in the README MUST exist in the repository at the time of writing. Verify existence before writing.
- Every README MUST open with the exact header structure shown in the "Header Format" section below, including the language toggle. Adapt badges, project name, and description to the project; do not omit the structure.
- Do not output README content as a code block in the conversation. Use the Edit or Write tool to write the files directly.

## Header Format (Required)

Every README must open with this exact structure — adapt the badges, project name, and description to the project at hand:

```markdown
# <Project Name> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/<label>-<message>-<color>)

[![<Badge1 Label>](<badge-url>)](<link>) [![<Badge2 Label>](<badge-url>)](<link>)

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)
```

For README.zh-CN.md, reverse the language toggle:

```markdown
# <Project Name> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/<label>-<message>-<color>)

[![<Badge1 Label>](<badge-url>)](<link>) [![<Badge2 Label>](<badge-url>)](<link>)

[English](README.md) | **简体中文**
```

Choose badges that reflect what is genuinely true about the project. Common types: CI status, license, language/runtime version, package registry version, code coverage. Use shields.io static badges when there is no live endpoint. Prefer reference-style Markdown links for badge rows with more than two badges — it keeps the source readable. Broken or always-failing badges are worse than no badges; only include ones that are maintained.

## Process

### 1. Survey the project

Before writing anything, read the actual project state:

- Scan all skill/module directories and their SKILL.md or equivalent descriptor files
- Note each component's name, one-line purpose, installation method, and any notable prerequisites
- Check git log for recent additions or removals
- Read the existing README files to understand what is already there and what has gone stale

Write from ground truth, not from memory or assumption.

### 2. Draft README.md (English)

Use `references/template.md` as the structural starting point. Adapt section names to the project's domain — the template shows the skeleton, not the words.

**Section order** (omit what doesn't apply, don't add sections just to fill space):
1. Header — title + badges + language toggle
2. One-liner description (one sentence)
3. Logo, banner, or demo GIF — optional, but place it early if the project has one
4. Main content sections (Available Items, Usage, etc.)
5. Contributing / Adding a new item
6. License

For READMEs over ~300 lines, add a Table of Contents after the one-liner.

The README is a directory, not a tutorial. Keep each component description to one or two sentences. Installation commands must be copy-pasteable — exact commands, no ambiguity. Always use fenced code blocks with a language tag (` ```bash `, ` ```json `).

Write with a human voice. README prose is some of the most AI-trope-prone writing that exists — it tends to accumulate "robust", bold-first bullet points, and "serves as" constructions without anyone noticing. Specific things to watch for:

- Word choice: avoid "leverage", "streamline", "robust", "utilize", "delve". Say the plain thing.
- Bullets: don't start every item with a bolded phrase. It reads as AI-generated documentation.
- Descriptions: say what the component does, not what it "serves as" or "stands as".
- Marketing tone: "powerful", "seamless", "comprehensive" add nothing. Cut them.
- Filler transitions: "It's worth noting", "Importantly", "Notably" — delete these.

A useful test: read each sentence aloud. If it sounds like promotional copy, rewrite it as a plain statement of fact.

### 3. Draft README.zh-CN.md (Chinese)

Translate the English README faithfully. Rules:

- Use natural Simplified Chinese — do not translate technical terms that are universally used in English (CLI tool names, package manager commands, GitHub URLs, code blocks).
- Keep all code blocks, commands, and file paths identical to the English version.
- Section headings should be idiomatic Chinese (e.g., "available skills", "adding a new skill"), not word-for-word translations.
- The language toggle must be `[English](README.md) | **Simplified Chinese**`.
- Apply the same plain-language discipline as the English version. Chinese technical writing has its own AI tells — avoid buzzwords where a simpler word works.

### 4. Review before writing

Before writing either file, verify:

- Every skill/component listed actually exists in the repository right now
- Installation commands are copy-pasteable and accurate
- No section describes something that has been removed
- Both files cover the same content in the same order

Then scan the draft for writing issues:

- Em-dashes used more than 2-3 times total? Cut most of them.
- Any sentence starts with "The X serves as..."? Rewrite as "The X is...".
- Bold-first bullet pattern throughout? Remove the bold.
- Same word or metaphor repeated across multiple descriptions? Vary it.
- Unicode arrows (→)? Replace with plain text.

### 5. Write the files

Write README.md first, then README.zh-CN.md. Use the Edit or Write tool — do not output the content as a code block in the conversation.

After writing, briefly confirm what changed (e.g., "Added update-readme skill, removed stale apple-events prerequisite note").
