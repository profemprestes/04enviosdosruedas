# Bail-Out Reference

Detailed protocol for the bail-out check at the top of `../SKILL.md`. The full pipeline (per-batch coordinator + sprint contract + evaluator + handoff machinery) is calibrated for plans with 5+ tasks across 2+ batches. Smaller plans suffer net overhead.

## Bail-out trigger

Total task count from `_index.md` "Execution Plan" YAML is `< 5` AND would resolve to a single batch.

## Bail-out response (output verbatim, then proceed)

> Plan has < 5 tasks in a single batch; the per-batch coordinator + evaluator + handoff machinery is overhead. Executing tasks inline (read each task file, implement, verify) and committing once. To force the full pipeline, re-invoke as `/superpowers:executing-plans --force <plan-path>`.

## Inline execution mode (after bail-out)

1. Read each task file from the plan directory in dependency order (respect `depends-on` from YAML)
2. For each task:
   - Apply BDD Red-Green discipline if a test/impl pair exists
   - Run the verification command from the task file
   - Mark verification status inline in your response (no TaskUpdate ceremony)
3. After the last task, run a single git commit covering all changes (see `../../skills/references/git-commit.md`)
4. Output a plain one-line completion summary

Skip: sprint contract, handoff-state.md, sprint-contract-batch-N.md, evaluation-round-N-batch-M.md, plans-completed.jsonl append. None apply to inline execution.

## Override

`--force` as a literal token anywhere in `$ARGUMENTS` bypasses the check. Do not infer override from prose ("please force this") — only the literal token counts, to avoid accidental over-invocation.
